      <p> The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected every person and industry around the world. One industry especially impacted by the pandemic is the restaurant industry. Restaurants suffered major losses due to the pandemic. Restaurants either closed or lost a significant amount of revenue because customers were not leaving their homes. Restaurant sales reflect the downturn, but also tell the story of how the industry has persevered and worked towards a strong recovery. Establishments have had to find new ways to make money, but now, in 2022, the industry continues to get stronger.  What are some possible factors that are leading to the resurgence? </p>

            <p>   Not surprisingly, restaurant sales took a large dip in March of 2020 and an even larger one in April 2020. As the spring approached and the weather got warmer, sales increased due to outdoor seating. As the weather improved, the opportunity to sit comfortably apart from others in an open air environment was crucial for people who wanted to get out after spending over two months primarily in their homes. What’s interesting about this chart is that starting in Fall of 2021, restaurant sales shot way up. Even accounting for inflation, restaurant sales rose higher than before the pandemic.. Mary Messineo, manager of Blue Moon Mexican Cafe in Wyckoff New Jersey, says these high sales levels may not be sustainable, though the industry should remain strong. During the summer of 2021, Blue Moon was granted the ability to put additional tables in the parking lot next to the restaurant. According to the  <a href="https://restaurant.org/education-and-resources/resource-library/customer-demand-for-outdoor-dining-rose-due-to-the-delta-variant/#:~:text=In%20a%20September%202021%20survey,reported%20similarly%20in%20September%202020.">National Restaurant Association</a>
              , the delta variant caused an increase in demand for outdoor seating and an increase in the amount of restaurants that offered outdoor seating in September 2021. Restaurants were granted permission by their respective municipalities to expand their seating limitations due to the pandemic, therefore, customer capacity increased in the restaurant. However, Messineo says that these policies could return to pre-pandemic levels as COVID becomes less of a threat, though it’s uncertain when that could be. </p>

            This line graph represents the monthly percentage change in sales in the restaurant industry. The graph also shows consistency within the industry and how restaurants are tracking. Large percentage increases and decreases between months signifies inconsistency, while smaller percent changes signify more consistency. With the large drop in sales in March and April of 2020, the percentage change in sales plummeted and then significantly increased in May 2020 as the weather started to get warmer. In terms of consistency, it appears that the industry is showing similar month to month trends as before the pandemic, except it appears that there was a larger percentage increase in March 2021 than in March before the pandemic. In February 2021, there was a COVID surge and according to the CDC, the 97,309 new cases that were reported on February 11 which was higher than what had been reported during the previous two pandemic spikes .This led to February 2021 was the only time restaurant sales dropped in the month of February between 2019-2022. Because of this difference in sales in February, sales in March 2021 skyrocketed at an unusually high rate.

            Strategies used by restaurants during the pandemic can provide insights into how the restaurant industry may be able to improve going forward. One strategy is the use of teenage employment. Messineo has seen more of an eagerness from teenagers rather than adults to work at Blue Moon, which has a reputation of being a teenage-friendly work environment. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/demographics.htm">According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, over 100,000 more teenagers worked in the U.S. 2021 than in 2019, which provides more opportunities for restaurants to hire employees.
            A strategy that Messineo says has been successful is providing family-friendly meal packages. These meal packages have been especially popular among online delivery orders. Sales have increased due to online ordering becoming more popular with the inclusion of access to large meals which can feed whole families.
            Messineo stressed the importance of being prepared for anything when working in the restaurant industry. While the COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented event, she believes that having the passion and the drive to make things work and adapt to a scary and evolving public health crisis helped set Blue Moon Mexican Cafe up for success over the past few years.

    Although the future of the restaurant industry and the pandemic remain unknown, it appears that the industry is trending in a positive direction. Different restaurants have had their own methods of staying afloat during these extremely difficult times. Restaurant customers can only hope that the situation keeps improving and that they will be able to continue to enjoy their favorite restaurants as they please.
